# Simple Time Changer

Basic time changer mod for Minecraft Forge 1.8.9 that doesn't suck

## Difference: 

Doesn't mess up Singleplayer (hopefully)
Doesn't overwrite the getTime method (messes up other mods and debug info)
Doesn't replace the entire NetHandler

## Features:

Set time to any value between 0-23999
Sync time with your IRL time
